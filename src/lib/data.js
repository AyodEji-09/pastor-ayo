    title: "PARENTING PRINCIPLES",
    description: `Parenting is the most important job in the world. Unfortunately, there is no formal training for it. Parents play a critical role in shaping the lives of their children, and by extension, future generations.
    More than a role and responsibility, parenting is a divine calling and assignment, as children are a gift from God. There are various principles passed down to us by God, the Master Parent, in the Bible to guide us in parenting.
    In this book, “Parenting Principles”, you will learn important principles of parenting, according to God’s word, to guide you in raising children in line with godly standards. This book is a divine framework filled with biblical wisdom and practical advice to help you in your parenting journey, a journey I am also on.
    As you read “Parenting Principles”, apply the principles written in it and become a star parent, raising, guiding and shaping future generations, one child at a time.`,

    title: "LOVE: The Essence of Christianity",
    description: `Love’ is a popular concept with various wrong definitions. However, the Bible, which is the ever true and reliable word of God defines and explains what love is. “LOVE, The Essence of Christianity” sheds light on the unconditional love of God. It explains love as a sacrificial act by delving into the sacrificial love of Christ; it explores selflessness, true love and practical examples of sacrificial love. In this book, we will examine LOVE as explained in the bible as the core of Jesus’ message and the foundation of Christianity. As you read this book, may you understand God’s love for you, and become a channel of that love to everyone around you.`,

      "THE ANOINTING AND THE ANOINTED: Sustaining the Power of God in the Life of a Man using the lives of Samuel, Elijah, and Elisha as case studies",
    description: `It is important to remember that God's divine plan for all humankind at the very beginning was great. It serves as a reminder that we were created with purpose and intentionality by a loving Creator who desires that we live fulfilling lives in harmony, peace, health, and joy. The devil came and scattered the plan of God in the Garden of Eden; however, our loving God wouldn't give up on restoring man to his unique position and design. That's why He has been sending His anointed right from time to deliver His people from all works of the devil. This book, "The Anointing and the Anointed," therefore explores the life of some selected Anointed men of God, projecting their lives and drawing vital lessons that would go a long way in receiving and sustaining God's anointing upon the present day’s believers and servants of God. Are you a child of God, a believer, or a servant of God? This book is just for you! You can't afford to miss reading it. Get your own copy, read, apply, and share your testimonies.`,
